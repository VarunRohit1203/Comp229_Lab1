	<h2><span lang="en-ca"><u>Agent Profile</u></span></h2><br>
    <p>If you're familiar with the Toronto's real estate market, chances are 
	you've heard Rene Rodriguez's name a time or two. His career has been a 
	long one, with some recent successes including the sale of the penthouse 
	at The Lydon in Back Bay for $14.3 million as well as the sale of a building
	on Union Park being converted into a grand single-family home. He's also 
	recognized as one of the top multi-family sales brokers in Greater Toronto.</p>
    <p>As the trusted real estate advisor for my clients, I understand that selling
	and/or buying a home is complex and deeply personal. There is also a lot at stake 
	financially and personally. This perspective on the process and the responsibility
	felt towards my clients drives me to truly be an expert at the job. I understand the 
	market, the players, and all of the variables involved in a real estate transaction. 
	I want to make sure you feel supported and that 
	you have a trusted advisor by your side.</p><br>
	<h2><span lang="en-ca"><u>Why me?</u></span></h2><br>
	<p>As a seller, you want to effectively (and beautifully) market the home and then negotiate 
	to secure the highest possible price and cleanest terms for the sale. As a buyer, you want 
	a patient, yet assertive partner to help to buy the right home for you, at the best possible 
	price. In other words, you want to make sure you don't leave any money on the table. This is 
	where our team steps in to partner with you as your consultant, negotiator and project manager.</p><br>

	<p>Varun had a wealth of knowledge about the house selling process. He assessed a selling 
		price far greater than what we had expected and supported that price with data. He specified 
		what needed to be done for our house to sell quickly and with little negotiation. We followed 
		through on his  suggestions and our house was under contract in less than 2 days from when it 
		was listed. It sold for our full asking price, and Elizabeth assisted us through the entire 
		process. He even shared useful [...]<br><br>
